# MyDash

### Your Personalized Google Dashboard

MyDash is a full-stack web application created by the mob [Hi5](https://github.com/Salt-Hi5/) as our final project during the 13-week bootcamp at [**`</salt>`** (School of Applied Technology)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/applied-technology-stockholm/mycompany/). Designed to replace the homepage in the your browser of choice, MyDash gives you an overview of all your Google services, with the ability to see your emails, calendar appointments and recent files — all in a single place.

The application's frontend is written in TypeScript using React. It has a primary backend written in C# using ASP.NET, and a secondary one to handle the API calls with Google, written in JavaScript using Node.js and Express.js. It uses a SQL Server to store non-sentitive user settings, and is deployed using Azure.
